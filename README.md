            <h2>Computer Engineering</h2>
            <h5>Computer engineering is where computer science and electrical engineering 
                meet. Computer engineers design, build and debug the hardware required to
                 run all kinds of computers — from phones, airplanes and communications
                  networks to medical devices.

                The Major in Computer Engineering helps you develop a depth and breadth of
                 expertise in computer hardware and software and will allow you to engage
                  with theoretical and practical issues in well-equipped laboratories.
                
                The program is designed to meet the growing industry demand for engineers
                 with a strong background in modern computer technology. You will graduate 
                 with the foundational knowledge required for graduate studies in all 
                 fields of Computer Engineering.</h5>

            </h2>
            <h5>Technically, mechanical engineering is the application of the principles
                 and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing
                  to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work
                   using the principles of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs 
                   function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost.

            Civil Engineering 
            </h2>
            <h5>civil engineering, the profession of designing and executing structural
                 works that serve the general public, such as dams, bridges, aqueducts,
                  canals, highways, power plants, sewerage systems, and other 
                  infrastructure. The term was first used in the 18th century to 
                  distinguish the newly recognized profession from military
                   engineering, until then preeminent. From earliest times, however, 
                   engineers have engaged in peaceful activities, and many of the civil
                    engineering works of ancient and medieval times—such as the Roman
                     public baths, roads, bridges, and aqueducts; the Flemish canals; 
                     the Dutch sea defenses; the French Gothic cathedrals; and many 
                     other monuments—reveal a history of inventive genius and 
                     persistent experimentation.
